QA-Testing
==========

This will be a collection of projects I'll be working on that will help with testing whether its automated or manual.
It will also contain documentation that will help with recording testing coverage, releases, tools, etc.

I will begin by setting up my mac to be a dev environment and then continue to configure my system to be able to run
automation for a webapp as well as an iOS app. Some of software I will be using includes Cucumber, Ruby, Watir, and 
Selenium to name a few.  I have found a few sites that will guide me with my setups and configurations to start.
